# temperature-monitoring-alert-system
In this project we use Bolt Iot wifi module ESP8266 to connect with Bolt Iot cloud and send alert via mail or sms if the temperature value crosses the minimum and maximum value of the temperature. This project uses twilio api to send sms or mail to the owner.
This project is about The pharmaceutical companies which use a cooling chamber to keep the tablets and maintain the temperature in the required limits. So making a device which notifies via Email or Sms for any sudden change in temperature or if it goes out of the defined threshold.
